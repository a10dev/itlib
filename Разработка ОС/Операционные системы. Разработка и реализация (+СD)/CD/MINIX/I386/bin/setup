Note 3: The installation procedure is described in the manual page

Note 4: Some questions have default answers, like this: [y]
	Simply hit RETURN (or ENTER) if you want to choose that answer.

Minix needs one primary partition of at least 30 Mb (it fits in 20 Mb, but
it needs 30 Mb if fully recompiled.  Add more space to taste.)

If there is no free space on your disk then you have to back up one of the
other partitions, shrink, and reinstall.  See the appropriate manuals of the
the operating systems currently installed.  Restart your Minix installation
after you have made space.

To make this partition you will be put in the editor \"part\".  Follow the
advice under the '!' key to make a new partition of type MINIX.  Do not
touch an existing partition unless you know precisely what you are doing!
Please note the name of the partition (hd1, hd2, ..., hd9, sd1, sd2, ...
sd9) you make.  (See the devices section in usage(8) on Minix device names.)
