REBOOT(2)                 Minix Programmer's Manual                  REBOOT(2)


NAME
     reboot - close down the system or reboot

SYNTAX
     #define _MINIX_SOURCE 1

     #include <unistd.h>

     int reboot(int how, ...)

DESCRIPTION
     Reboot() is used to close down the system.  It  allows  several  ways  of
     shutting down depending on how:

     reboot(RBT_HALT)
          Halt the system and return to the monitor prompt.

     reboot(RBT_REBOOT)
          Reboot the system by letting the monitor execute the "boot" command.

     reboot(RBT_PANIC)
          Cause a system panic.  This is not normally done from user mode, but
          by servers using the sys_abort() kernel call.

     reboot(RBT_MONITOR, code, length)
          Halt the system and let the monitor execute the given  code  of  the
          given length.  (code is of type char * and length of type size_t.)

     reboot(RBT_RESET)
          Reboot the system with a hardware reset.

     Reboot() may only be executed by the super-user.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the call succeeds, it never returns.  If  something  went  wrong,  the
     return value is -1 and an error is indicated by errno.

SEE ALSO
     shutdown(8), reboot(8), halt(8), sync(1).

NOTES
     Minix can not return to the monitor  if  running  in  real  mode,  or  if
     started  from  MS-DOS.  This means that most of the reboot functions will
     change to a reset.
