CHDIR(2)                  Minix Programmer's Manual                   CHDIR(2)


NAME
     chdir - change current working directory

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int chdir(const char *path)

DESCRIPTION
     Path is the pathname of a directory.   Chdir  causes  this  directory  to
     become  the  current working directory, the starting point for path names
     not beginning with ``/''.

     In order for a directory to become the current directory, a process  must
     have execute (search) access to the directory.

RETURN VALUE
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     Chdir will fail and the current working directory will  be  unchanged  if
     one or more of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named directory does not exist.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for any component of the  path
                    name.

     [EFAULT]       Path points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                    file system.
