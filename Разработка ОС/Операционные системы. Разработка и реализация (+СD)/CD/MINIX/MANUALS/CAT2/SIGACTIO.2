SIGACTION(2)              Minix Programmer's Manual               SIGACTION(2)


NAME
     sigaction, signal - manage signal state and handlers

SYNOPSIS
     #include <signal.h>

     int sigaction(int sig, const  struct  sigaction  *act,  struct  sigaction
          *oact)
     void (*signal(int sig, void (*handler)(int)))(int);

DESCRIPTION
     Sigaction() is used to examine,  set,  or  modify  the  attributes  of  a
     signal.   The  argument  sig is the signal in question.  The act argument
     points to a structure containing the new attributes of  the  signal,  the
     structure pointed to by oact will receive the old attributes that were in
     effect before the call.

     The act and oact arguments may be NULL to indicate  that  either  no  new
     attributes are to be set, or that the old attributes are not of interest.

     The structure containing the signal attributes is defined  in  <signal.h>
     and looks like this:

          struct sigaction {
              void        (*sa_handler)(int sig);
              sigset_t    sa_mask;
              int         sa_flags;
          };

     The sa_handler field contains the address of a signal handler, a function
     that  is  called  when  the process is signalled, or one of these special
     constants:

     SIG_DFL     Default signal handling is to  be  performed.   This  usually
                 means  that  the  process  is killed, but some signals may be
                 ignored by default.

     SIG_IGN     Ignore the signal.

     The sa_mask field indicates a set of signals that must  be  blocked  when
     the  signal  is  being handled.  Whether the signal sig itself is blocked
     when being handled is not controlled by this mask.   The  mask  is  of  a
     "signal set" type that is to be manipulated by the sigset(3) functions.

     How the signal is handled precisely is specified by bits in sa_flags.  If
     none  of  the  flags  is  set  then the handler is called when the signal
     arrives.  The signal is blocked during  the  call  to  the  handler,  and
     unblocked  when  the  handler returns.  A system call that is interrupted
     returns -1 with errno set to EINTR.  The following bit flags can  be  set
     to modify this behaviour:


                                                                             1

     SA_RESETHAND   Reset the signal handler to SIG_DFL  when  the  signal  is
                    caught.

     SA_NODEFER     Do not block the signal on entry to the handler.

     SA_COMPAT      Handle the signal in a way that is compatible with the the
                    old signal() call.

     The old signal() signal system call sets a signal  handler  for  a  given
     signal  and  returns the old signal handler.  No signals are blocked, the
     flags are SA_RESETHAND | SA_NODEFER | SA_COMPAT.  New code should not use
     signal().   Note  that  signal()  and  all  of  the  SA_* flags are Minix
     extensions.

     Signal handlers are reset to SIG_DFL on an execve(2).  Signals  that  are
     ignored stay ignored.

  Signals
     Minix knows about the following signals:

     SIGHUP     1      k       Hangup
     SIGINT     2      k       Interrupt (usually DEL or CTRL-C)
     SIGQUIT    3      kc      Quit (usually CTRL-\)

     k    The process is killed if the signal is not caught.

     c    The signal causes a core dump.

     i    The signal is ignored if not caught.

     v    Only Minix-vmd implements this signal.

     x    Minix extension, not defined by POSIX.

     p    These signals are not implemented, but POSIX requires that they  are
          defined.

     s    The process should be stopped, but is killed instead.

     The SIGKILL signal cannot be caught or ignored.  The SIGILL  and  SIGTRAP
     signals  cannot  be  automatically  reset.   The system silently enforces
     these restrictions.  This may or may not be reflected by  the  attributes
     of these signals and the signal masks.

  Types
     POSIX prescribes that <sys/types.h> has the following definition:

          typedef int (*sighandler_t)(int)

     With this type the following declarations can be made:

          sighandler_t sa_handler;
          sighandler_t signal(int sig, sighandler_t handler);

     This may help you to understand the  earlier  declarations  better.   The
     sighandler_t  type  is  also  very  useful  in  old  style C code that is
     compiled by a compiler for standard C.

SEE ALSO
     kill(1), kill(2), pause(2), sigprocmask(2), sigsuspend(2), sigpending(2),
     sigset(3).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Sigaction() returns 0 on success or -1 on error.   Signal()  returns  the
     old handler on success or SIG_ERR on error.  The error code may be:

     EINVAL    Bad signal number.

     EFAULT    Bad act or oact addresses.
