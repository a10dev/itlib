SIGSUSPEND(2)             Minix Programmer's Manual              SIGSUSPEND(2)


NAME
     sigsuspend - suspend until signalled

SYNOPSIS
     #include <signal.h>

     int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *set)

DESCRIPTION
     Sigsuspend() installs the signal mask referenced by set and suspends  the
     process  until  signalled.   The  signal  is  handled, the signal mask is
     restored to the value it  had  before  the  sigsuspend()  call  and  call
     returns.

SEE ALSO
     pause(2), sigaction(2), sigpending(2), sigprocmask(2), sigset(3).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Sigsuspend() never returns normally, so it always returns -1.  The  error
     code  is either EINTR indicating that a signal has arrived, or EFAULT for
     a bad set address.
