NAME
     alarm - schedule signal after specified time

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds)

DESCRIPTION
     Alarm causes signal SIGALRM, see sigaction(2), to be sent to the invoking
     process  in  a number of seconds given by the argument.  Unless caught or
     ignored, the signal terminates the process.

     Alarm requests are not stacked; successive calls reset the  alarm  clock.
     If  the  argument  is  0,  any  alarm  request  is  canceled.  Because of
     scheduling delays, resumption of execution of when the signal  is  caught
     may be delayed an arbitrary amount.

     The return value is the amount of time previously remaining in the  alarm
     clock.
