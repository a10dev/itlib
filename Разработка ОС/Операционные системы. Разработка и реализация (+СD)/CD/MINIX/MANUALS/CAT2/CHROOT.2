CHROOT(2)                 Minix Programmer's Manual                  CHROOT(2)


NAME
     chroot - change root directory

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int chroot(const char *dirname)

DESCRIPTION
     Dirname is the address of the pathname of a directory,  terminated  by  a
     null  byte.   Chroot  causes this directory to become the root directory,
     the starting point for path names beginning with ``/''.

     In order for a directory to become the root directory a process must have
     execute (search) access to the directory.

     This call is restricted to the super-user.

RETURN VALUE
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate an error.

ERRORS
     Chroot will fail and the root directory will be unchanged if one or  more
     of the following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path name is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named directory does not exist.

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for any component of the  path
                    name.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EFAULT]       Path points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
                    file system.
