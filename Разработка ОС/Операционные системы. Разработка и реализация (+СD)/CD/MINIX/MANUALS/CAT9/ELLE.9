Command:   elle - ELLE Looks Like Emacs
Syntax:    elle file [file2]
Flags:     (none)
Example:   elle file.c              # Start the editor

     ELLE (ELLE Looks Like Emacs) is an Emacs clone for MINIX.  ELLE  is
not full Emacs but it has about 80 commands and is quite fast.


Key bindings


     Mined only has a small number of commands.  All of them are  either
of  the  form  CTRL-x or are on the numeric keypad.  Emacs, in contrast,
has so many commands, that not only are all the CTRL-x commands used up,
but  so  are  all the ESC x (escape followed by x; escape is not a shift
character, like CTRL).  Even this is not enough, so CTRL-X is used as  a
prefix for additional commands.  Thus CTRL-X CTRL-L is a command, and so
is CTRL-X K.  Note that what  is  conventionally  written  as  CTRL-X  K
really  means  CTRL-X  k.   In  some contexts it is traditional to write
CTRL-X as ^X.  Please note that they mean the same thing.

     As a result, many Emacs commands need three or four key strokes  to
execute.   Some  people  think  3-4  key  strokes is too many.  For this
reason, Emacs and ELLE allow users to assign their own key bindings.  In
ELLE  this  is  done  with  'user  profiles.'   A user profile is a file
listing which function is invoked by which key stroke.  The user profile
is  then compiled by a program called ellec into binary form.  When ELLE
starts up it checks to see if a file .ellepro.b1 exists in $HOME.  If it
does, this file is read in and overrides the default bindings.

     A user profile that simulates the mined  commands  fairly  well  is
provided.  Its  installation is described later.  If you have never used
Emacs, it is suggested that you use the mined profile. If  you  normally
use  Emacs,  then  do  not install the mined profile.  You can also make
your own using ellec.  There is no Mock Lisp.

     ELLE has a  character-oriented  view  of  the  world,  not  a  line
oriented view, like ed. It does not have magic characters for searching.
However, you can use line feed in search patterns. For example, to  find
a  line  consisting of the three characters 'foo' all by themselves on a
line, using the mined bindings (see  below),  use  the  pattern:  CTRL-\
CTRL-J  f  o  o  CTRL-\  CTRL-J.   The CTRL- means to interpret the next
character literally, in this case it is CTRL-J, which is line feed.  You
can  also search for patterns involving multiple lines.  For example, to
find a line ending in an 'x' followed by a line beginning  with  a  'y',
use as pattern: x CTRL- CTRL-J y.

Mined Key Bindings



                                                                        



                                                                        


     These are the key bindings if the binary user profile, .ellepro.b1,
is  installed in $HOME.  The ESCAPE key followed by a number followed by
a command causes that command  to  be  executed  'number'  times.   This
applies  both  to  control characters and insertable characters.  CTRL-X
refers to a 'control character.'  ESC x refers to  an  escape  character
followed by x.  In other words, ^X is a synonym for CTRL-X.  ^X Y refers
to CTRL-X followed by y.  To abort the current command and  go  back  to
the main loop of the editor, type CTRL-G, rather than CTRL-\.

     Only a few commands are of the form CTRL-X Y.   All  of  these  are
also bound to CTRL-X CTRL-Y, so you can hold down CTRL and then hit X Y,
or release control after the X, as you prefer.

     The key bindings that are not listed should not be used.   Some  of
them actually do things.  For example, the ANSI escape codes ESC [ x are
bound to ^X Y for a variety of y.

     Some commands work on regions.  A region is  defined  as  the  text
between the most recently set mark and the cursor.

The major differences between ELLE with  the  mined  profile  and  mined
itself are:

   1. The definition of a 'word' is different for forward  and  backward
   word
   2. The mark is set with CTRL-^ instead of CTRL-@
   3. Use CTRL-G to abort a command instead of CTRL-\
   4. Use CTRL- to literally insert the next character, instead of ALT
   5. CTRL-E adjusts the window to put the cursor in the middle of it
   6. To get and insert a file, use ESC G instead of CTRL-G
   7. To go to line n, type ESC n CTRL-[ instead of CTRL-[ n
   8. You exit with CTRL-X CTRL-X and then answer the question with 'y'.
   9. There are many new commands, windows, larger files, etc.


Emacs Key Bindings

     If you do not  have  the  mined  profile  installed,  you  get  the
standard  Emacs  key  bindings.   These  are  listed below. Commands not
listed are not implemented.

   CURSOR MOVEMENT
      CTRL-F         Forward one character.
      CTRL-B         Backward one character.

      ESC F          Forward one word.
      ESC B          Backward one word.

   DELETING
      CTRL-D         Deletes forward one character (the one  the  cursor
                     is under).
      DELETE         Deletes backward one character (the one to left  of
                     cursor).
      ESC D          Kills forward one word.
      ESC DEL        Kills backward one word.

                     'normal'    - Begin searching immediately.
                     ^G          - Cancel I-search, return to start.
                     DEL         - Erase  last  char,  return  to   last

ELLE profile

     It is possible to create your own user profile.  The  mechanism  is
different  from  Emacs,  since ELLE does not have Mock Lisp.  Proceed as
follows.


   Modify .ellepro.e to suit your taste.

   Install .ellepro.e in your home directory.
