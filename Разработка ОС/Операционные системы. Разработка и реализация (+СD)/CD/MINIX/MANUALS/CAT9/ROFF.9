     Roff is a text formatter.  Its input consists of  the  text  to  be
output,  intermixed with formatting commands.  A formatting command is a
line containing the  control  character  followed  by  a  two  character
command name, and possibly one or more arguments.  The control character
is initially '.' (dot).  The formatted output is  produced  on  standard
output.

     The formatting commands are listed below, with n being a number,  c
being  a  character,  and t being a title.  A + before n means it may be
signed, indicating a positive or negative change from the current value.
Initial values for n, where relevant, are given in parentheses.
