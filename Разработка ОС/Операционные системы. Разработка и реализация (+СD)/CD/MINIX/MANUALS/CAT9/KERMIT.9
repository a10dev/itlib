Command:   kermit - transfer a file using the kermit protocol
Syntax:    kermit
Flags:     (many)
Example:   kermit                   # Start kermit

     This is a slightly  lobotomized  kermit.   The  help  command,  the
script facility, and the automatic dial support have been removed. The ?
and ESC commands still work, so there is still reasonable built-in help.
The  only  V7  kermit  feature  that does not work is the ability to see
whether there are input characters waiting.  This means  that  you  will
not be able to ask for status during a file transfer (though this is not
critical, because kermit prints a dot every so often and  other  special
characters whenever there is an error or timeout).

     Start kermit, and then type the  following  to  open  a  2400  baud
session, for example:

        set line /dev/tty1
        set speed 2400
        connect

(It is more convenient if you put these commands in .kermrc in your home
directory, so that they get done automatically whenever you run kermit.)
This will connect you to the modem or whatever on the serial port.   Now
log into the other system.

     When you want to transfer files, run kermit on  the  other  system.
To it, type

        server

This puts its kermit into a  sort  of  'slave  mode'  where  it  expects
commands from the kermit running on your MINIX system.  Now come back to
the command level on  MINIX  kermit,  by  typing  the  escape  character
followed  by c.  (Kermit will tell you the current escape character when
you do the connect command.)   At  this  point  you  can  issue  various
commands.  Your  kermit  will coordinate things with kermit on the other
machine so that you only have to  type  commands  at  one  end.   Common
commands are

        get filename
        put filename
        remote dir

Filenames can include wildcards.  By default, kermit works in a  system-
independent,  text  mode.  (In effect it assumes that the whole world is
MS-DOS and converts end of line and file names  accordingly.)   To  send
binary files, you will want to type

        set file type bin


                                                                        



                                                                        


on both ends before starting any transfers.   This  disables  CR  LF  to
newline  conversion.   If  both of your systems are some flavor of UNIX,
you might as well put this in .kermrc on both ends  and  run  in  binary
mode  all  the  time.   Also, if both systems are UNIX it is recommended
that you use

        set file name lit

on both ends.  This causes it to keep file names unchanged, rather  than
mapping to legal MS-DOS names.

     Here is a typical .kermrc for use on MINIX:

        set line /dev/tty1
        set speed 1200
        set esc 29
        set file type bin
        set file name lit
        set retry 90
        set prompt MINIX kermit>
        connect

     On the other end of the line, for example, the host at  your  local
computer  center  to which you want to transfer files, a typical profile
might be:

        set rec packet 1000
        set fil name lit
        set fil type bin
        server


     Kermit has many other options and features.   For  a  pleasant  and
highly readable description of it, see the following book:

Over 400 versions of kermit are available, so it is likely there is  one
for  any  computer  your  MINIX  system might want to talk to.  Columbia
University  also  publishes  a  newsletter  about  kermit  that  can  be
