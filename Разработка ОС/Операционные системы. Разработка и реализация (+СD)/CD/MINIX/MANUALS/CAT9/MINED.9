Command:   mined - MINIX editor
Syntax:    mined [file]
Flags:     (none)
Examples:  mined /user/ast/book.3   # Edit an existing file
           mined                    # Call editor to create a new file
           ls -l | mined            # Use mined as a  pager  to  inspect

     Mined is a simple screen editor.  At any instant, a  window  of  24
lines  is  visible  on  the screen.  The current position in the file is
shown by the cursor.  Ordinary characters typed in are inserted  at  the
cursor.   Control  characters  and  keys  on  the numeric keypad (at the
right-hand side of the keyboard) are used to move the cursor and perform
other functions.

     Commands exist to move forward and  backward  a  word,  and  delete
words  either  in  front  of  the  cursor  or behind it.  A word in this
context is a sequence of characters delimited  on  both  ends  by  white
space  (space,  tab,  line  feed,  start  of file, or end of file).  The
commands for deleting characters and words  also  work  on  line  feeds,
making  it  possible  to join two consecutive lines by deleting the line
feed between them.

     The editor maintains one save buffer (not displayed).  Commands are
present to move text from the file to the buffer, from the buffer to the
file, and to write the buffer onto a  new  file.   If  the  edited  text
cannot  be  written  out due to a full disk, it may still be possible to
copy the whole text to the save buffer and then write it to a  different
file on a different disk with CTRL-Q.  It may also be possible to escape
from the editor with CTRL-S and remove some files.

     Some of the commands  prompt  for  arguments  (file  names,  search
patterns,  etc.).   All  commands  that might result in loss of the file
being edited prompt to ask for confirmation.

     A key (command or ordinary character) can be repeated  n  times  by
typing ESC n key where ESC is the 'escape' key.

     Forward and backward searching requires a regular expression as the
search  pattern.   Regular  expressions  follow the same rules as in the
UNIX editor, ed.  These rules can be stated as:


   Any displayable character matches itself.

   . (period) matches any character except line feed.

   ^ (circumflex) matches the start of the line.

   $ (dollar sign) matches the end of the line.


                                                                     



                                                                     


   \c matches the character c (including period, circumflex, etc).

   [string] matches any of the characters in the string.

   [^string] matches any  of  the  characters  except  those  in  the
   string.

   [x-y] matches any characters between x and y (e.g., [a-z]).

   Pattern* matches any number of occurrences of pattern.


Some examples of regular expressions are:

   The boy     matches the string 'The boy'
   ^$          matches any empty line.
   ^.$         matches any line containing exactly 1 character
   ^A.*\.$     matches any line  starting  with  an  A,  ending  with  a
               period.
   ^[A-Z]*$    matches any line  containing  only  capital  letters  (or
               empty).
   [A-Z0-9]    matches any line containing either a capital letter or  a
               digit.
   .*X$        matches any line ending in 'X'
   A.*B        matches any line containing an 'A' and then a 'B'


     Control characters cannot be entered into a file simply  by  typing
them  because  all  of  them  are  editor  commands.  To enter a control
character, depress the ALT key, and then while holding it down, hit  the
ESC  key.   Release  both  ALT  and  ESC and type the control character.
Control characters are displayed in reverse video.
