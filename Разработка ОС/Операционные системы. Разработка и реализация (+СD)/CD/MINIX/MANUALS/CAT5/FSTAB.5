NAME
     fstab, mtab - list of file systems to mount, mounted file system table.

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/fstab

     /etc/mtab

DESCRIPTION
     /etc/fstab is a table of file system to mount at boot time, /etc/mtab  is
     a  table  of  currently  mounted  file systems as maintained by mount and
     umount.

     /etc/fstab is not read by mount as it should be.  It is instead a  simple
     shell  script listing the three devices that Minix needs to operate:  The
     device names of the  root  file  system,  the  temporary  (scratch)  file
     system, and the file system for /usr.  Of these only the /usr file system
     is mounted in /etc/rc, the scratch file system is there  for  the  system
     administrator to test new kernels, or as a temporary file system.

     /etc/mtab contains lines of four fields.  The layout is:

          device    directory    type    options

     These fields may be explained as follows:

     device
          A block special device.

     directory
          Mount point.

     type
          Either 1, or 2, indicating a V1 or V2 file system.

     options
          Either ro, or rw, indicating a read-only or read-write mounted  file
          system.

FILES

     /etc/fstab     Shell script naming three important file systems.
