.SH DESCRIPTION
The current process is suspended from execution for the number
of seconds specified by the argument.

The routine is implemented by setting an alarm timer
and pausing until it occurs.

If the sleep time exceeds the time to the expiration of the
previous timer,
the process sleeps only until the signal would have occurred, and the
signal is sent 1 second later.
