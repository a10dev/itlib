NAME
     recwave - record an audio file in MicroSoft PCM wave format

SYNOPSIS
     recwave [-b -s -r] file

DESCRIPTION
     Recwav takes samples from /dev/audio and writes them to file in Microsoft
     PCM wave format.

OPTIONS

     -b   number of bits to use for one sample. Must be 8 or 16, default is 8

     -s   enable stereo sampling. 0 = mono (default), 1 = stereo

     -r   sample rate in samples/sec. 4000 - 44100 (default 22050)

BUGS
     The highest sample rate that can be used depends  on  the  speed  of  the
     system   and   the   size   of   the  DMA  buffer  used  in  the  driver.
