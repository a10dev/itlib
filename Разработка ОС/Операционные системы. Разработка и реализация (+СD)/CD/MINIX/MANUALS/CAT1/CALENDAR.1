     calendar            # Normary used under the control of cron(8)

     calendar -r         #  Normary used in /etc/rc file

DESCRIPTION

     Basically calendar program consults the  file  calendar  in  the  current
     directory  and  display  lines  which contain today's or tomorrow's date.
     Month-day formats such as '12/25',  'Dec.  25',  'december  25',  '*/25',
     '12/*',  '*/*'  are  recognized.   The asterisk means 'all' days or 'all'
     months.  On weekends 'tomorrow' extends through next Monday  without  any
     consideration  about  holidays.   To  prevent  ambiguity, the formats '25
     Dec.' and '25/12' are not recognized.

     When an argument - is present, calendar works for all users with  a  file
     calendar  in  their login directories and sends them mail.  Normally this
     is done daily under the control of cron.

     The -r option does its the same job as - option, but touches the calendar
     to prevents further access on the same day.  Normally this is done in the
     /etc/rc file on a machine  which may be booted several times in one day.
