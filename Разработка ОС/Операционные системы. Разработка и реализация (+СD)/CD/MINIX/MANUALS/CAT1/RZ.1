SYNOPSIS
     rz [-abepqvy] [-t timeout]

OPTIONS

     -a   CP/M to UNIX conventions

     -b   Binary file

     -e   Escape for all control characters

     -p   Protect file if it already exists

     -q   Quiet; opposite of verbose

     -t   Set timeout in tenths of a second

     -v   Verbose; opposite of quiet

     -y   Yes, clobber existing files

                         # Receive a file

DESCRIPTION

     The XMODEM, YMODEM, and ZMODEM  family  of  file  transfer  programs  are
     widely  used  on  personal  computers.   MINIX  supports ZMODEM, the most
     advanced of the set.  The programs sz and rz are  used  for  sending  and
     receiving, respectively.

     Rz and sz are programs that uses an error correcting protocol to transfer
     files over a dial-in serial port from a variety of programs running under
     various operating systems.  Rz (Receive ZMODEM) receives files  with  the
     ZMODEM  batch  protocol.   Pathnames are supplied by the sending program,
     and directories are made if necessary (and possible).   The  meanings  of
     the available options are:
     -a
        Convert files to UNIX conventions by stripping  carriage  returns  and
        all characters beginning with the first Control Z (CP/M end of file).
     -b
        Binary (tell it like it is) file transfer override.
     -c
        Request 16 bit CRC.  XMODEM file transfers default to 8 bit  checksum.
        YMODEM and ZMODEM normally use 16 bit CRC.


                                                                             1

     -D
        Output file data to /dev/null; for testing.
     -e
        Force sender to escape all control  characters;  normally  XON,  XOFF,
        DLE, CR-@-CR, and Ctrl-X are escaped.
     -p
        Protect: skip file if destination file exists.
     -q
        Quiet suppresses verbosity.
     -t
        Change timeout tenths of seconds (timeout follows flag).
     -v
        Verbose causes a list of file names to be appended to /tmp/rzlog. More
        v's generate more output.
     -y
        Yes, clobber any existing files with the same name.
