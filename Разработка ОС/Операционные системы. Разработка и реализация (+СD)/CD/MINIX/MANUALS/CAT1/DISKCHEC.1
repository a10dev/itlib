NAME
     diskcheck - check a disk for bad sectors

SYNOPSIS
     diskcheck device start count

EXAMPLES

     diskcheck /dev/at0 0 1200
                         # Check 1.2 MB diskette

     diskcheck /dev/at0 100 50
                         # Check blocks 100 to 149

DESCRIPTION

     Diskcheck checks a disk for  bad  sectors  by  reading  in  each  sector,
     writing  a  known  bit  pattern onto it, reading it back in and comparing
     with what was written.  This check is  then  done  a  second  time.   Bad
     sectors  are  reported.  After each sector is tested, the original sector
     is restored.  Only use this program on unmounted partitions.  Killing  it
     part way through may result in lost data.
