NAME
     cat - concatenate files and write them to stdout

SYNOPSIS
     cat [-u] [file] ...

OPTIONS

     -u   Unbuffered output

EXAMPLES

     cat file            # Display file on the terminal

     cat file1 file2 | lpr
                         # Concatenate 2 files and print result

DESCRIPTION

     Cat concatenates its input files and copies the result to stdout.  If  no
     input  file  is named, or - is encountered as a file name, standard input
     is used.  Output is buffered in 512 byte blocks unless  the  -u  flag  is
     given.   If  you  just want to copy a file, cp should be used since it is
     faster.
