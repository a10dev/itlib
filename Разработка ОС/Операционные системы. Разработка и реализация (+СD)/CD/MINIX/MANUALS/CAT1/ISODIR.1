NAME
     isodir - list ISO9660 or High Sierra directories

SYNOPSIS
     isodir -[lr] input_file [dir]

DESCRIPTION
     Isodir reads directories on a file system in ISO9660 or High Sierra Group
     format  (usually  residing on cdrom) and lists their contents on standard
     output.  Directory names should contain slashes to  separate  components.
     The names isodir, isoread, and isoinfo are all links to the same program.
     The program sees which function to perform by looking how it was called.

     -l   Lists all info on files and directories (size, date, time)

     -r   Recursively descend and print subdirectories

BUGS
     Only Interchange level-1  is  supported.  The  Red  Rock  extensions  and
     Interchange level-2 are not implemented.
