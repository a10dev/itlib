NAME
     tail - print the last few lines of a file

SYNOPSIS
     tail [-c n] [-f] [-n n] [file] ...

OPTIONS

     -c   The count refers to characters

     -f   On FIFO or special file, keep reading after EOF

     -n   The count refers to lines

EXAMPLES

     tail -n 6           # Print last 6 lines of stdin

     tail -c 20 file     # Print the last 20 characters of file

     tail -n 1 file1 file2
                         # Print last line of two files

     tail -n +8 file     # Print the tail starting with line 8

DESCRIPTION

     The last few lines of one or more files are printed.  The  default  count
     is 10 lines.  The default file is stdin.  If the value of n for the -c or
     -n flags starts with a + sign, counting starts at the  beginning,  rather
     than the end of the file.
