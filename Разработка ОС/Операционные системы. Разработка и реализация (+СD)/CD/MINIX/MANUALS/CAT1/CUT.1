NAME
     cut - select out columns of a file

SYNOPSIS
     cut [  -b | -c] list [file...]
     cut -f list [-d delim] [ -s]

OPTIONS

     -b   Cut specified bytes

     -c   Select out specific characters

     -d   Change the column delimiter to delim

     -f   Select out specific fields that are separated by the

     -i   Runs of delimiters count as one

     -s   Suppres lines with no delimiter characters, when used

EXAMPLES

     cut -f 2 file       # Extract field 2

     cut -c 1-2,5 file   # Extract character columns 1, 2, and 5

     cut -c 1-5,7- file  # Extract all columns except 6

DESCRIPTION
     [file...]" delimiter character ( see delim)" with the  -f  option.  Lines
     with no delimiters are passwd through untouched"

     Cut extracts one or more fields or columns from a file and writes them on
     standard  output.   If the -f flag is used, the fields are separated by a
     delimiter character, normally a tab, but can  be  changed  using  the  -d
     flag.   If  the  -c flag is used, specific columns can be specified.  The
     list can be comma or BLANK separated. The -f and -c flags   are  mutually
     exclusive.   Note: The POSIX1003.2 standard requires the option -b to cut
     out specific bytes in a file. It is intended for systems with multi  byte
     characters  (e.g. kanji), since MINIX uses only one byte characters, this
     option is equivalent to -c. For the same reason, the  option  -n  has  no
     effect and is not listed in this manual page.
