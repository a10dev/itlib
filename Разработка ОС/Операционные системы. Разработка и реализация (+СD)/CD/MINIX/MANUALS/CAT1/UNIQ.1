DESCRIPTION

     Uniq examines a file for consecutive lines that are identical.   All  but
     duplicate entries are deleted, and the file is written to output.  The +n
     option skips the first n fields, where a field is defined  as  a  run  of
     characters  separated  by  white  space.  The -n option skips the first n
     spaces.  Fields are skipped first.
