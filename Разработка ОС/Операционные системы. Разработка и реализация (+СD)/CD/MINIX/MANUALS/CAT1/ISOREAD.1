NAME
     isoread - read a file in ISO9660 or High Sierra format

SYNOPSIS
     isoread [input_file] file

DESCRIPTION
     Isoread reads a file in ISO9660 or  High  Sierra  Group  format  (usually
     residing  on  cdrom) and lists its contents on standard output.  The file
     path should contain slashes to separate  components.  The  names  isodir,
     isoread,  and isoinfo are all links to the same program. The program sees
     which function to perform by looking how it was called.

     Interchange level-2 are not implemented.
