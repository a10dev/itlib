NAME
     cp, cpdir - file copy

SYNOPSIS
     cp [-pifsmrRvx] file1 file2
     cp [-pifsrRvx] file ... directory
     cpdir [-ifvx] file1 file2

OPTIONS

     -p   Preserve full mode, uid, gid and times

     -i   Ask before removing existing file

     -f   Forced remove existing file

     -s   Make similar, copy some attributes

     -m   Merge trees, disable the into-a-directory trick

     -r   Copy directory trees with link structure, etc. intact

     -R   Copy directory trees and treat special files as ordinary

     -v   Display what cp is doing

     -x   Do not cross device boundaries

EXAMPLES

     cp oldfile newfile  # Copy oldfile to newfile

     cp -R dir1 dir2     # Copy a directory tree

DESCRIPTION

     Cp copies one file  to  another,  or  copies  one  or  more  files  to  a
     directory.   Special  files  are  normally  opened and read, unless -r is
     used.  -r also copies the  link  structure,  something  -R  doesn't  care
     about.   The  -s  option differs from -p that it only copies the times if
     the target file already exists.  A normal copy only copies  the  mode  of
     the  file, with the file creation mask applied.  Set-uid bits are cleared
     if the owner cannot be set.  (The -s  flag  does  not  patronize  you  by
     clearing bits.  Alas -s and -r are nonstandard.)

     Cpdir is a convenient synonym for cp -psmr to make a precise  copy  of  a
     directory tree.
