DESCRIPTION

     Od dumps a file in one or more formats.  If file  is  missing,  stdin  is
     dumped.   The  offset argument tells od to skip a certain number of bytes
     or blocks before starting.  The offset is in octal bytes,  unless  it  is
     followed by a '.' for decimal or b for blocks or both.
