DOSREAD(1)                Minix Programmer's Manual                 DOSREAD(1)


NAME
     dosread - read a file from an MS-DOS diskette [IBM]

SYNOPSIS
     dosread [-a] drive file

OPTIONS

     -a   ASCII file

EXAMPLES

     dosread C g/adv >adv
                         # Read file g/adv from hard disk

     dosread -a A prog.c >x
                         # Read ASCII file prog.c from drive A

DESCRIPTION

     Dosread reads one MS-DOS file and writes it on standard output.  The file
     name  must use slash, not backslash as a separator.  ASCII files have the
     final CTRL-Z stripped, and carriage return plus line feed are  mapped  to
     line  feed  only,  the  usual MINIX convention.  See dosdir on the use of
     single letter drive codes.
