NAME
     uname, arch - system info

SYNOPSIS
     uname [-snrvmpa]
     arch [-snrvmpa]

OPTIONS

     -s   System name

     -n   Node/network name

     -r   Operating system release

     -v   Operating system version

     -m   Machine type

     -p   Processor family

     -a   Short for -snrvm

EXAMPLES

     uname -n            # Print the name of the system

     arch                # Print the name of the system architecture

DESCRIPTION

     Uname and arch give information about the system.  The  options  indicate
     which  information  strings must be printed.  These strings are always in
     the same order.  Uname and arch only differ w.r.t. the default string  to
     print, -s and -p respectively.

     The strings are compiled into the commands except for the node  name,  it
     is obtained from the file /etc/hostname.file.  Uname -m should return the
     actual machine type, not the same string as with -p.
