DESCRIPTION
     Stty shows or  changes  the  parameters  of  the  terminal  connected  to
     standard  input.   Stty  takes  a  myriad  of arguments most of which are
     mapped directly to the flags and special characters described in  tty(4),
     so we won't describe them here.

     Stty has three forms of operation.  First,  without  any  arguments  stty
     shows  all terminal attributes that are different from the default state.
     Option -a makes stty print all terminal  attributes,  and  -g  lets  stty
     print  the  attributes  in  a special encoded form, a simple row of colon
     separated hexadecimal numbers.

     In the second form of operation stty takes an encoded form as produced by
     the -g option and sets the terminals attributes to its decoded value.

     In the third form stty  interprets  a  series  of  flags  and  parameters
     settings  and modifies the terminal attributes accordingly.  Flags can be
     given as icanon or -icanon for instance, either setting or  clearing  the
     ICANON  flag.   Special  character  values  can  by  set like intr=^C for
     example, which sets the interrupt character to CTRL-C.   You  can  either
     use  a real CTRL-C, or the two characters `^' and `C'.  In any case it is
     probably necessary to use quotes to guard it from the shell:  intr='^C'.

     A number alone is interpreted as a baud rate setting for both  the  input
     and output rate.  The input or the output rate can be set separately with
     use of the ispeed and ospeed prefixes to the number.  The character  size
     can be set with cs5, cs6, cs7 or cs8.

     The MIN and TIME value, and the number of rows and columns of the  window
     can  also  be  set  using  one  of  the keywords min, time, rows or cols,
     followed by a decimal number that is the value of the setting.




                                                                             1

     Stty accepts several keywords that are not named by  corresponding  flags
     or parameters in tty(4).  They set several attributes at once:

     cooked
          Same as icrnl ixon opost onlcr isig icanon iexten echo, setting  all
          the attributes that are needed for line oriented mode.

     raw  Same as -icrnl -ixon -opost  -onlcr  -isig  -icanon  -iexten  -echo,
          setting all the attributes for a raw data channel.

     evenp parity
          These synonyms are equal to cs7 parenb -parodd, setting the line  to
          7 bits even parity.

     oddp Same as cs7 parenb parodd, setting the line to 7 bits odd parity.

     -parity -evenp -oddp
          All synonyms for cs8 -parenb, setting the line to 8 bits, no parity.

     nl   Same  as  icrnl,  setting  carriage  return  to  line   feed   input
          translation.

     -nl  Same as -icrnl -inlcr -igncr, disabling any carriage return or  line
          feed handling.

     ek   Set the ERASE and KILL special characters back to the default.

     sane Set all attributes to the default except things like the line  speed
          and  parity, because their "sane" value is probably what it is right
          now.  The default values are compiled into stty from the <termios.h>
          include file.  Use stty sane; stty -a to know what they are.

FILES

     /etc/ttytab    The init field of this file may contain an stty command to
                    set  the attributes to match an attached RS232 terminal or
                    modem.

SEE ALSO
     tty(4), ttytab(5).

NOTES
     The cooked, raw, rows and cols keywords are Minix  additions  beyond  the
     keywords  defined  by  POSIX.   Rows and cols are common UNIX extensions,
     however.  There are more  Minix  specific  flags  that  match  the  Minix
     specific attributes described in tty(4).
