NAME
     fmt - adjust line-length for paragraphs of text

SYNOPSIS
     fmt [-width] [files]...

DESCRIPTION
     fmt is a simple text formatter.   It  inserts  or  deletes  newlines,  as
     necessary,  to  make  all  lines in a paragraph be approximately the same
     width.  It preserves indentation and word spacing.

     The default line width is 72 characters.  You can override this with  the
     -width  flag.   If you don't name any files on the command line, then fmt
     will read from stdin.

     It is typically used from within vi to adjust the line breaks in a single
     paragraph.  To do this, move the cursor to the top of the paragraph, type
     "!}fmt", and hit <Return>.
