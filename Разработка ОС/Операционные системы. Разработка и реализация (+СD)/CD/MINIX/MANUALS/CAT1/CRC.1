CRC(1)                    Minix Programmer's Manual                     CRC(1)


NAME
     crc - print the checksum of the file data

SYNOPSIS
     crc file ...

EXAMPLES

     crc *.c             # Print checksums of all the C programs

DESCRIPTION

     The checksum of each argument is computed and  printed,  along  with  the
     file  length and its name, one file per line.  This program is useful for
     seeing if a file transmitted to another machine  has  arrived  correctly.
     It  is  conceptually  similar  to  sum,  except  that  it uses a stronger
     checksum algorithm and also prints the length.

SEE ALSO
     cksum(1), sum(1).
