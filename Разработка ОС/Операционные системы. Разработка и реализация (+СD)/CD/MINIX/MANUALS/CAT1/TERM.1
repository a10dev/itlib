NAME
     term - turn PC into a dumb terminal [IBM]

SYNOPSIS
     term [baudrate] [parity] [bits_per_character] [-dial_string] [device]

EXAMPLES

     term 2400           # Talk to modem at 2400 baud

     term 1200 7 even    # 1200 baud, 7 bits/char, even parity

     term 8 9600 /dev/tty01
                         # 9600 baud, 8 bits/char, no parity, use tty01

     term -atdt12345 /dev/tty01
                         # Start with a command to dial out

DESCRIPTION

     Term allows MINIX to talk to a terminal or modem over RS232 port 1.   The
     program  first  sets  the baudrate, parity and character length, and then
     forks.  The parent sits  in  a  loop  copying  from  stdin  (usually  the
     console's  keyboard),  to  the  terminal or modem (/dev/tty00). The child
     sits in a loop  copying  from  the  terminal  or  modem  (/dev/tty00)  to
     standard  output.  Thus  when RS232 port 1 is connected to a modem, every
     keystroke typed on the keyboard is sent to the modem, and every character
     arriving  from  the modem is displayed.  Standard input and output may be
     redirected, to  provide  a  primitive  file  transfer  program,  with  no
     checking.  Any argument that starts with a minus ('-') is sent out to the
     modem, usually to dial out.   Term  accepts  several  commands  that  are
     formed  by typing the escape character, CTRL-], and a letter.  Type CTRL-
     ]? to see a list of commands.  The subshell command is very important, it
     allows  you  to  type  in a ZMODEM command to transfer data.  Do not quit
     term to do this, or your modem line will be reset!  Term keeps the  modem
     line  open  on  file  descriptor 9 while running the subshell, so you can
     type

           <&9 >&9

     at the end of your ZMODEM command to connect it to the modem.

     Important note:  to  use  term,  it  is  essential  that  /etc/ttytab  is
     configured  so that there is no shell hanging on /dev/tty01. If there is,
     both the shell and term will try to read  from  /dev/tty01,  and  nothing
     will work.
