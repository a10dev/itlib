NAME
     whatsnew - print a newly modified file, marking changes

SYNOPSIS
     whatsnew [-n] file.c file.c.cdif

OPTIONS

     -n   Output line length

EXAMPLES

     whatsnew file.c file.c.cdif
                         # Print file.c with changes marked

     whatsnew -70 file.c file.c.cdif

DESCRIPTION

     It commonly occurs that cdifs are posted to USENET.  After  installing  a
     cdif  file, it is sometimes desirable to print out the new file, with the
     changes marked on it.  Whatsnew does precisely this, with the  changes  +
     and ! printed in the right-hand margin.
