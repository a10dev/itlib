NAME
     unshar - Remove files from a shell archive

SYNOPSIS
     unshar [-btvx] sharfile member ...

     -b   Unshar brutally, overwriting files if need be

     -t   Tell what is in the archive but do not extract

     -v   Verbose mode

     -x   Extract only the members listed

EXAMPLES

     unshar arch.sh      # Extract all members of the archive

     unshar -t arch.sh   # List the contents of the archive

     unshar -xf1 -xf2 arch.sh

DESCRIPTION

     Unshar extracts members of a shell archive, the same as sh,  except  much
     faster.   It  expects  shell  archives  created  with  shar.  It also has
     options to list the contents of  a  shell  archive,  and  to  selectively
     extract some members but not all.
