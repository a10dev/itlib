EJECT(1)                  Minix Programmer's Manual                   EJECT(1)


NAME
     eject - eject removable media

SYNOPSIS
     eject device

DESCRIPTION
     Eject tells a device to eject removable media, usually a  floppy  or  CD-
     ROM.   Eject  invokes  the DIOCEJECT ioctl on the device.  The media will
     then be ejected, or allowed to be removed.  The call  will  fail  if  the
     device is still in use.

     Tapes can't be unloaded with this command, use mt offline instead.

SEE ALSO
     mt(1), hd(4), sd(4).
