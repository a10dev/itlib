NAME
     pretty - MINIX pretty printer

SYNOPSIS
     pretty file ...

EXAMPLES

     pretty file1 file2  # Convert two files to MINIX layout

DESCRIPTION

     Pretty converts one or more C source files to MINIX  format  by  changing
     their  layout.  Running this program does not affect the resulting binary
     programs.  Actually, pretty is a postprocessor for indent, which must  be
     installed in /bin or /usr/bin.  Although the output is not bad, it is not
     entirely consistent with the book or even with itself.
