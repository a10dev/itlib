NAME
     rsh - remote shell

SYNOPSIS
     rsh [-n] [-l username] host [command]
     host [-n] [-l username] [command]

DESCRIPTION
     Rsh connects to the specified host, and executes the  specified  command.
     Rsh  copies its standard input to the remote command, the standard output
     of the remote command to its standard output, and the standard  error  of
     the  remote command to its standard error.  Interrupt, quit and terminate
     signals are propagated to the remote  command;  rsh  normally  terminates
     when the remote command does.

     The remote username used is the same as your local username,  unless  you
     specify  a  different  remote  name with the -l option.  This remote name
     must be equivalent  (in  the  sense  of  rlogin(1))  to  the  originating
     account; no provision is made for specifying a password with a command.

     If you omit command, then instead of executing a single command, you will
     be logged in on the remote host using rlogin(1).

     Shell metacharacters which  are  not  quoted  are  interpreted  on  local
     machine,  while  quoted  metacharacters  are  interpreted  on  the remote
     machine.  Thus the command

          rsh otherhost cat remotefile >> localfile

     appends the remote file remotefile to the localfile localfile, while

          rsh otherhost cat remotefile ">>" otherremotefile

     appends remotefile to otherremotefile.

OPTIONS

     -l username
          Specify the remote user name.

     -n   Connect standard input of the remote command to /dev/null.  Do  this
          if rsh should not inadvertently read from standard input.

SEE ALSO
     rcp(1), rlogin(1), rhosts(5).

BUGS
     You cannot run an interactive  command  (like  rogue(6)  or  vi(1));  use
     rlogin(1).
