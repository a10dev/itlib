NAME
     rcp - remote file copy

SYNOPSIS
     rcp [-p] file1 file2
     rcp [-pr] file ...  directory

DESCRIPTION
     Rcp copies files between machines.  Each file or  directory  argument  is
     either  a  remote  file  name of the form ``rhost:path'', or a local file
     name (containing no `:' characters, or a `/' before any `:'s).

     If  the  -r  option  is  specified  and  any  of  the  source  files  are
     directories,  rcp  copies  each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
     the destination must be a directory.

     By default, the mode and owner of  file2  are  preserved  if  it  already
     existed;  otherwise  the mode of the source file modified by the umask(2)
     on the destination host is used.  The -p option causes rcp to attempt  to
     preserve  (duplicate)  in  its copies the modification times and modes of
     the source files, ignoring the umask.

     If path is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to your login
     directory  on  rhost.  A path on a remote host may be quoted (using \, ",
     or ') so that the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.

     Rcp does not prompt for passwords; your  current  local  user  name  must
     exist on rhost and allow remote command execution via rsh(1).

     Rcp handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files are
     on the current machine.  Hostnames may also take the form ``rname@rhost''
     to use rname rather than the current user name on the remote  host.   The
     destination  hostname  may  also take the form ``rhost.rname'' to support
     destination machines that are running 4.2BSD versions of rcp.

SEE ALSO
     cp(1), ftp(1), rsh(1), rlogin(1).

BUGS
     Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might be  a  file  in
     cases where only a directory should be legal.
     Is confused by any output generated by commands in a .profile, or  .*shrc
     file on the remote host.
