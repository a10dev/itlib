RECOVER(1)                Minix Programmer's Manual                 RECOVER(1)


NAME
     recover - recover files that have been removed.

SYNOPSIS
     recover file ...

EXAMPLES

     rm x; recover x     # Unremove x

     recover a b c       # Recover three files

DESCRIPTION

     MINIX allows files that have been deleted (e.g., with rm) to be  restored
     (in  /tmp).  The trick is that when a file is unlinked, its i-node number
     is kept in the directory entry.  As long as the directory entry and  disk
     blocks  are  not  reused,  the  file  can  be recovered.  This program is
     actually just a little front end for de, which must  be  installed  as  a
     set-uid root executable.
