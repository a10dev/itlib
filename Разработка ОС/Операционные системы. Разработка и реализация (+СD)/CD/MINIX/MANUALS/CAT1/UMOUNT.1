NAME
     umount - unmount a mounted file system

SYNOPSIS
     umount special

OPTIONS
     (none)

EXAMPLES

     umount /dev/fd1     # Unmount diskette 1

DESCRIPTION

     A mounted file system is unmounted after the cache has  been  flushed  to
     disk.   A  diskette should never be removed while it is mounted.  If this
     happens, and is discovered  before  another  diskette  is  inserted,  the
     original  one  can  be replaced without harm.  Attempts to unmount a file
     system holding working directories or open files will be rejected with  a
     'device busy' message.
