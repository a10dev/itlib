HOSTADDR(1)               Minix Programmer's Manual                HOSTADDR(1)


NAME
     hostaddr - show ethernet address, IP address or hostname

SYNOPSIS
     hostaddr [-eia] [-E eth-device] [-I ip-device]

DESCRIPTION
     Without any of the -eia options, hostaddr shows the ethernet address,  IP
     address  and  hostname  of the local host on one line in the given order.
     With options only the wanted fields are shown, still in the  same  order,
     not in option order.

OPTIONS

     -e   Show the ethernet address.

     -i   Show the IP address.  This will not work if no IP address  has  been
          found by RARP or by setting it with ifconfig(8).

     -a   Show the fully qualified hostname.  The IP address is shown again if
          it can't be translated to a host name.  (This usually indicates that
          the DNS reverse address translation tables are incomplete.)

SEE ALSO
     ifconfig(8), rarpd(8), nonamed(8), set_net_default(8), boot(8).

DIAGNOSTICS
     "Timeout"
     Hostaddr timed out trying to get the IP address.   This  means  that  the
     network  connection  is  out of order or that the setup of the machine is
     bad.
