SPELL(1)                  Minix Programmer's Manual                   SPELL(1)


NAME
     spell - print all words in a file not present in the dictionary

SYNOPSIS
     spell file

EXAMPLES

     spell document      # Print the spelling errors on stdout

DESCRIPTION

     Spell is the MINIX spelling checker. It is actually a short shell script.
     First,  the  program  prep  strips off the roff, nroff, and troff control
     lines, and the punctuation, and lists  each  word  on  a  separate  line.
     These  words  are  then sorted.  The resulting output is then compared to
     the dictionary.  Words present  in  the  file  but  not  present  in  the
     dictionary   are   listed.    The   dictionary   must   be   located   in
     /usr/lib/dict/words.
