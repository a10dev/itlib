M(1)                      Minix Programmer's Manual                       M(1)


NAME
     M, U - conveniently mount and unmount

SYNOPSIS
     M device [-r]
     U device

OPTIONS

     -r   Mount read-only

EXAMPLES

     M root              # Mount the RAM image on /root

     M 0                 # Mount /dev/fd0 on /fd0

     U fd1               # Unmount /dev/fd1 from /fd1

DESCRIPTION

     M and U allow easy mounting and unmounting of a device by using  only  an
     abbreviated  device name or keyword.  Special keywords are root, tmp, and
     usr for the three hard disk partitions Minix runs in.  Floppy devices are
     mounted  on /fd0 or /fd1.  You can use 0 and 1 instead of fd0 and fd1.  A
     device it doesn't know about is mounted on /mnt.
