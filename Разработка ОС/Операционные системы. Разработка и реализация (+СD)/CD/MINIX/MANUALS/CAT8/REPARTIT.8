REPARTITION(8)            Minix Programmer's Manual             REPARTITION(8)


NAME
     repartition - load a partition table

SYNOPSIS
     repartition device [partition-file]

DESCRIPTION
     Repartition uploads a new partition table for the partitions  of  device.
     The  table  is obtained from the first sector of partition-file if given,
     device otherwise.  Device may refer to  the  whole  drive  or  a  primary
     partition,  depending  on  whether  you  want  to upload a partition or a
     subpartition table.  The partitions will be truncated to fit  within  the
     enclosing device like the disk driver does, unless the numbers are coming
     from partition-file.

EXAMPLES
     repartition /dev/hd0
     repartition /dev/hd4 /etc/hd4.table

     Reload the partition table of  drive  0  setting  /dev/hd[1-4],  and  the
     subpartition  table  of /dev/hd4 setting /dev/hd4[a-d] using a file.  The
     latter may be useful if you need more than the 4 subpartitions  a  single
     Minix partition gives you.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The new table is printed on standard output.

FILES
     /dev/hd[0-9]

SEE ALSO
     hd(4), part(8).

BUGS
     The disk must be in use for the changes to stick.  The partition table of
     an idle disk will be reloaded on the first open.
