NAME
     readclock - read the real time clock [IBM PC/AT and AMIGA]

SYNOPSIS
     readclock

EXAMPLES

     date `/usr/bin/readclock` </dev/tty
                         # Useful in /etc/rc

DESCRIPTION

     Readclock reads the AT's real time clock and prints the result in a  form
     useful  to date, namely, MMDDYYhhmmss. If the clock does not exist (e.g.,
     on a PC), it outputs '-q' to query the user for  the  time.  The  example
     given  above  can be put in /etc/rc to load the real time when the system
     is booted.
