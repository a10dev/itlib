SHUTDOWN(8)               Minix Programmer's Manual                SHUTDOWN(8)


NAME
     shutdown - graciously close the system down

SYNOPSIS
     shutdown [-hrRmk] [-x code] [time-specification [message]]

DESCRIPTION
     Shutdown is a program which allows a system operator to  close  down  the
     system in an nice way. Shutdown informs the users why and when the system
     is going down.  This warning is issued 10 minutes  before  shutdown  time
     and  every  minute  in  the  last  5  minutes.  At this time (5 minutes),
     shutdown creates a file /etc/nologin to prevent new  users  from  logging
     in.

     Shutdown keeps a logfile of shutdowns.  Every shutdown is  registered  in
     /usr/adm/wtmp,  if this file exists.  After these actions, a call is done
     to reboot(2) which actually brings the system down.

     Time-specification may be something like 15:00, 15.00, +15, or now for  a
     shutdown at 3pm (twice), 15 minutes from now, or immediately.

     The message may be used to describe why the system is going down, it  may
     also be typed on standard input with the -m option.

OPTIONS

     -h   This flag prevents the system from  rebooting  after  the  shutdown.
          The system can now be powered off.  This is the default.

     -r   This flag indicates that the system  should  reboot  after  shutting
          down.

     -R   Reboot the system by resetting it.  Normally the kernel will try  to
          return  to  the  Boot  Monitor.   With  -R the system will receive a
          hardware reset.

     -x code
          Halt the system and let the Monitor execute the  given  code  as  if
          typed at the monitor prompt.  You can for instance use -x 'boot hd0'
          as a very fast way to reboot "from the top."

     -m   Allows the operator to type a shutdown message  on  standard  input,
          that will be added to the messages displayed on all terminals.

     -k   This option gives the possibility of terminating an already  started
          shutdown.   This  is  only  possible  if  shutdown  time has not yet
          arrived.





                                                                             1

     -C   Check if the system crashed.  This option is not  used  at  shutdown
          time,  but  at  reboot time.  It tells if the file systems should be
          checked by testing if the last entry in the wtmp file is a  shutdown
          entry.  (A crude replacement for a file system clean flag.)

FILES
     /usr/adm/wtmp, /etc/nologin, /usr/adm/authlog

SEE ALSO
     reboot(2), wall(1), halt(8), boot(8).
