HALT(8)                   Minix Programmer's Manual                    HALT(8)


NAME
     halt - abruptly stop the system

SYNOPSIS
     halt [-f]

DESCRIPTION
     Halt stops the system almost immediately.  The  users  are  not  informed
     about  the  things  to  come.   Halt  is  logged  in /usr/adm/wtmp and in
     /usr/adm/authlog, if these files exist.  Halt should only be run  by  the
     super-user, any other caller will be refused.

     Halt is a rather rude program.  Shutdown(8) is preferred for it  performs
     a more gentle halt routine.

     Halt -f is even worse, it omits the terminate signals that  are  normally
     sent first to all processes to give them a chance to die peacefully.

SEE ALSO
     reboot(2), shutdown(8), reboot(8), boot(8).
