IFCONFIG(8)               Minix Programmer's Manual                IFCONFIG(8)


NAME
     ifconfig - configure a TCP/IP device

SYNOPSIS
     ifconfig [-I ip-device] [-h ipaddr] [-n netmask] [-iv]

DESCRIPTION
     Ifconfig initializes a  TCP/IP  device  setting  the  IP  address  and/or
     netmask.   It  will report the address and netmask set.  This command may
     be used if the system has not been configured properly yet.  It  is  only
     used  at boot time to set a fixed address for a system without a physical
     ethernet.  Normally the inet task will find it out  by  itself  from  the
     RARP server.

OPTIONS

     -h   The decimal TCP/IP address to set.

     -n   The netmask to set.

     -i   Don't set the IP address  or  netmask  if  already  set.   This  way
          ifconfig  cannot  interfere  if  the  numbers have been found out by
          RARP.

     -v   Report IP address and netmask.  This is the default action if  there
          are no other options.
