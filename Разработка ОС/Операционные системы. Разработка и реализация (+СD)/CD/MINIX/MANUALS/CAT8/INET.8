NAME
     inet - TCP/IP server

SYNOPSIS
     inet

DESCRIPTION
     Inet is the TCP/IP server.  It is a device driver that interfaces between
     the  file server and the low level ethernet device driver.  The interface
     to this server is described in ip(4).

     Inet is part of the kernel image under standard Minix.   Under  Minix-vmd
     it  starts as a normal process, but by using a few low level system calls
     it quickly turns itself into a server.

SEE ALSO
     ip(4).
