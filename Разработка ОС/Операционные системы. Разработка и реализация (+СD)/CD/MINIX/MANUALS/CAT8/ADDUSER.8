NAME
     adduser - add a new user to the system

SYNOPSIS
     adduser user group home-dir

EXAMPLES

     adduser ast other /usr/ast
                         # How user ast could be added

     adduser bin operator /usr/src
                         # How user bin could be added

DESCRIPTION

     Adduser adds  a  new  user  to  the  system  by  making  new  entries  in
     /etc/passwd  and  /etc/shadow  for  the  new  user,  creating  a new home
     directory, and copying  the  contents  of  the  template  home  directory
     /usr/ast  into  it.   The user-id of this new user will be the first free
     number not less than 10.  The password is initially empty, the full  name
     must  be  set,  and the shell is the Bourne Shell, /bin/sh . Use passwd ,
     chfn , and chsh to change.
