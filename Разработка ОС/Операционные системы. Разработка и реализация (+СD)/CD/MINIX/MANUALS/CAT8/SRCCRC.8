NAME
     srccrc - compute CRC checksums of the entire source tree

SYNOPSIS
     srccrc

OPTIONS

EXAMPLES

DESCRIPTION

     Srccrc traverses the entire /usr/include and /usr/src tree to run the crc
     command  on all files found.  The result is a long list of filenames with
     their checksums.  The filenames are relative to /usr.

     The command makes an effort to remove most junk files such  as  .o,  .bak
     and files in bin directories.  It cannot find single binaries however, so
     you will have to run make clean in /usr/src to be able to make a crc list
     that contains only source files.

     Two crc files can be compared easily with the diff command.  A  crc  list
     of the original source tree can be found in /usr/src/crclist.
