CHECKHIER(8)              Minix Programmer's Manual               CHECKHIER(8)


NAME
     checkhier - check the directory hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
     checkhier

DESCRIPTION
     Checkhier checks a number of files and directories that make up  the  top
     level  file system hierarchy.  The output of the command is a script that
     could be applied to fix things like bad mode, wrong owner or group, etc.

     The script should never be executed without checking.  I might be  better
     to examine the differences oneself and to fix any problems by hand.

     Checkhier must be run by the superuser.

SEE ALSO
     chmod(1), chown(8), hier(7).

DIAGNOSTICS
     The exit code is 0 if all checks out right, otherwise a script is  output
     and the exit code is 1.
