.I Roff
is a text formatter.
Its input consists of the text to be output, intermixed with formatting commands.
A formatting command is a line containing the control character followed by
a two character command name, and possibly one or more arguments.
The control character is initially \*(OQ.\*(CQ (dot).
The formatted output is produced on standard output.
.PP
The formatting commands are listed below, with
.I n
being a number,
.I c
being a character, and
.I t
being a title.
A + before \fIn\fP means it may be signed, indicating a positive or negative
change from the current value.
Initial values for
.I n ,
where relevant, are given in parentheses.
