DESCRIPTION
     These functions operate on null-terminated strings.  They  do  not  check
     for overflow of any receiving string.

     Strcat appends a copy of string s2 to the  end  of  string  s1.   Strncat
     copies  at  most  n  characters.   Both  return  a  pointer  to the null-
     terminated result.

     Strcmp compares its arguments and returns an integer greater than,  equal
     to,  or  less  than 0, according as s1 is lexicographically greater than,
     equal to, or less than s2.  Strncmp makes the same comparison  but  looks
     at at most n characters.

     Strcpy copies string s2 to s1, stopping after the null character has been
     moved.   Strncpy  copies exactly n characters, truncating or null-padding
     s2; the target may not be null-terminated if the length of  s2  is  n  or
     more.  Both return s1.

     Strlen returns the number of non-null characters in s.

STRING(3)                 Minix Programmer's Manual                  STRING(3)


     Strchr (strrchr) returns a pointer to  the  first  (last)  occurrence  of
     character c in string s, or null if c does not occur in the string.

     Strerror returns the error string for the system call error errnum.   See
     intro(2).

     Memcmp is like strcmp except that the strings are memory blocks of length
     n.  Null characters are treated as ordinary characters.

     Memcpy copies n bytes from the location pointed to by s2 to s1.   Memmove
     is  like  memcpy,  except  that  it  can  handle  overlap between the two
     strings.  Both functions return s1.

     Memchr returns a pointer to the first occurrence of character c in string
     s, or null if c does not occur in the string.

     Memset sets n bytes to c starting at location s.  It returns s.

     Index and rindex are obsolete versions of strchr and strrchr.   New  code
     should avoid using them.

NOTES
     Characters are compared as unsigned char, whether char itself  is  signed
     or not.
