NAME
     rand, srand - random number generator

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>

     void srand(unsigned seed)
     unsigned rand(void)

DESCRIPTION
     Rand uses a multiplicative  congruential  random  number  generator  with
     period 2**32 to return successive pseudo-random numbers in the range from
     0 to RAND_MAX.

     The generator is reinitialized by calling srand with 1 as  argument.   It
     can  be set to a random starting point by calling srand with whatever you
     like as argument.
