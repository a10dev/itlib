GETLOGIN(3)               Minix Programmer's Manual                GETLOGIN(3)


NAME
     getlogin - get login name

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     char *getlogin(void)

DESCRIPTION
     Getlogin returns a pointer to the login name as found in  /etc/utmp.   It
     may  be  used in conjunction with getpwnam to locate the correct password
     file entry when the same user ID is shared by several login names.

     If getlogin is called  within  a  process  that  is  not  attached  to  a
     terminal,  or  if  there  is  no  entry  in  /etc/utmp  for the process's
     terminal, getlogin returns a null pointer.  A  reasonable  procedure  for
     determining  the login name is to first call getlogin and if it fails, to
     call getpwuid(getuid()).

FILES
     /etc/utmp

SEE ALSO
     getpwent(3), utmp(5), ttyslot(3)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Returns a null pointer if the name cannot be found.

BUGS
     The return values point to static data whose content  is  overwritten  by
     each call.
