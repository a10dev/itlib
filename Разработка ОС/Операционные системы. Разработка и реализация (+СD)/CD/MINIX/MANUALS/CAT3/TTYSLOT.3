TTYSLOT(3)                Minix Programmer's Manual                 TTYSLOT(3)


NAME
     ttyslot, fttyslot - utmp slot number

SYNOPSIS
     #define _MINIX_SOURCE 1
     #include <unistd.h>

     int ttyslot(void)
     int fttyslot(int fd)

DESCRIPTION
     Ttyslot() returns the index of the login terminal in the utmp  file.   It
     tries fttyslot() on file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 to find the index.

     Fttyslot() returns the utmp index of the terminal  associated  with  file
     descriptor  fd.   First  it  tries  to  map  fd  to  a terminal name with
     ttyname(3), then it searches the ttytab(5) database with the getttyent(3)
     function  for this terminal.  This means that the utmp slot number is the
     same as the ttytab entry number counting from 1.  The value 0 is returned
     if no slot number can be found for a file descriptor.

SEE ALSO
     ttyname(3), getttyent(3), utmp(5), ttytab(5), init(8).

NOTES
     Since 0 is used as an error return this means that the first entry in the
     utmp file is not used.

     Ttyslot() is often found in a UNIX implementation,  fttyslot()  is  Minix
     specific.
