NAME
     end, etext, edata - last locations in program

SYNOPSIS
     extern int etext;
     extern int edata;
     extern int end, _end;

DESCRIPTION
     These names refer neither to routines nor to locations  with  interesting
     contents.   The  address  of etext is the first address above the program
     text, edata  above  the  initialized  data  region,  and  end  above  the
     uninitialized  data  region.   _end  is  the  same  as  end,  but  in the
     implementers name space, i.e. for use in libraries.

     When execution begins, the program break coincides with end,  but  it  is
     reset   by   the   routines   brk(2),  malloc(3),  standard  input/output
     (stdio(3)), etc.  The current value of  the  program  break  is  reliably
     returned by `sbrk(0)', see brk(2).

SEE ALSO
     brk(2), malloc(3).
