GETC(3)                   Minix Programmer's Manual                    GETC(3)


NAME
     getc, getchar, fgetc, getw - get character or word from stream

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     int getc(FILE *stream)
     int getchar(void)
     int fgetc(FILE *stream)
     int getw(FILE *stream)

DESCRIPTION
     Getc returns the next character from the named input stream.

     Getchar() is identical to getc(stdin).

     Fgetc behaves like getc, but is a genuine function, not a macro;  it  may
     be used to save object text.

     Getw returns the next int from the named input stream.   It  returns  the
     constant  EOF upon end of file or error, but since that is a good integer
     value, feof and ferror(3) should be used to check the  success  of  getw.
     Getw assumes no special alignment in the file.

SEE ALSO
     clearerr(3), fopen(3), putc(3), gets(3), scanf(3), fread(3), ungetc(3).

DIAGNOSTICS
     These functions return the integer constant EOF at end of file, upon read
     error,  or if an attempt is made to read a file not opened by fopen.  The
     end-of-file  condition  is  remembered,  even  on  a  terminal,  and  all
     subsequent  attempts  to  read  will  return  EOF  until the condition is
     cleared with clearerr(3).

BUGS
     Because it is implemented as a macro, getc treats a stream argument  with
     side  effects  incorrectly.   In  particular,  `getc(*f++);' doesn't work
     sensibly.
