NAME
     getpass - read a password

SYNOPSIS
     #include <minix/minlib.h>

     char *getpass(const char *prompt)

DESCRIPTION
     Getpass reads a password from the file /dev/tty, or  if  that  cannot  be
     opened, from the standard input, after prompting with the null-terminated
     string prompt and disabling echoing.  A pointer is returned  to  a  null-
     terminated string of at most 32 characters, excluding the null.

SEE ALSO
     crypt(3).

BUGS
     The return value points to static data whose content  is  overwritten  by
     each call.
