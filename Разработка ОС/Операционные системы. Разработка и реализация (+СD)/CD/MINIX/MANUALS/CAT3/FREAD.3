FREAD(3)                  Minix Programmer's Manual                   FREAD(3)


NAME
     fread, fwrite - buffered binary input/output

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t itemsize, size_t nitems, FILE *stream)
     size_t fwrite(void *ptr, size_t itemsize, size_t nitems, FILE *stream)

DESCRIPTION
     Fread reads, into a block beginning at ptr, nitems of data of the type of
     *ptr  from  the  named  input  stream.   It  returns  the number of items
     actually read.

     If stream is stdin and the standard output is  line  buffered,  then  any
     partial output line will be flushed before any call to read(2) to satisfy
     the fread.

     Fwrite appends at most nitems of data of the type of  *ptr  beginning  at
     ptr  to the named output stream.  It returns the number of items actually
     written.

SEE ALSO
     read(2),  write(2),  fopen(3),  getc(3),   putc(3),   gets(3),   puts(3),
     printf(3), scanf(3).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Fread and fwrite return 0 upon end of file or error.
