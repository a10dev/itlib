NAME
     qsort - quicker sort

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

     void qsort(void *base, size_t nel, size_t width, int (*compar)(const void
           *, const void *))

DESCRIPTION
     Qsort is an implementation of  the  quicker-sort  algorithm.   The  first
     argument  is  a pointer to the base of the data; the second is the number
     of elements; the third is the width of an element in bytes; the  last  is
     the  name of the comparison routine to be called with two arguments which
     are pointers to the elements being compared.  The routine must return  an
     integer  less  than,  equal  to, or greater than 0 according as the first
     argument is to be considered less than, equal to,  or  greater  than  the
     second.
