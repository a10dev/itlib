.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIFind\fR descends the file tree starting at the given directory checking
each file in that directory and its subdirectories against a predicate.
If the predicate is true, an action is taken.  The predicates may be
connected by \fB\-a\fR (Boolean and), \fB\-o\fR (Boolean or) and !
(Boolean negation).
Each predicate is true under the conditions specified below.  The integer 
\fIn\fR may also be +\fIn\fR to mean any value greater than \fIn\fR, 
\fI\-n\fR to mean any value less than
\fIn\fR, or just \fIn\fR for exactly \fIn\fR.

.ta 0.25i 1.0i
.nf
	\-name s	true if current filename is \fIs\fR (include shell wild cards)
	\-size n	true if file size is \fIn\fR blocks
	\-inum n	true if the current file's i-node number is \fIn\fR
	\-mtime n	true if modification time relative to today (in days) is \fIn\fR
	\-links n	true if the number of links to the file is \fIn\fR
	\-newer f	true if the file is newer than \fIf\fR
	\-perm n	true if the file's permission bits = \fIn\fR (\fIn\fR is in octal)
	\-user u	true if the uid = \fIu\fR (a numerical value, not a login name)
	\-group g	true if the gid = \fIg\fR (a numerical value, not a group name)
	\-type x	where \fIx\fR is \fBbcdfug\fR (block, char, dir, regular file, setuid, setgid)
	\-xdev	do not cross devices to search mounted file systems
.fi
.PP
Following the expression can be one of the following, telling what to do
when a file is found:
.PP
.nf
	\-print	print the file name on standard output
	\-exec	execute a \s-2MINIX\s0 command, {} stands for the file name
	\-ok	prompts before executing the command
.fi
