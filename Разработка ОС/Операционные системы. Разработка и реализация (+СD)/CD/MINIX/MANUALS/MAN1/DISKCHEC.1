.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIDiskcheck\fR checks a disk for bad sectors by reading in each sector,
writing a known bit pattern onto it, reading it back in and comparing with
what was written.  This check is then done a second time.  Bad sectors are 
reported.  After each sector is tested, the original sector is restored.
Only use this program on unmounted partitions.
Killing it part way through may result in lost data.
