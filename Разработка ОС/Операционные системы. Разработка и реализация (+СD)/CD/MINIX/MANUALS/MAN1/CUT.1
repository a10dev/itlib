.SH DESCRIPTION
[\fIfile...\fR]" 
delimiter character ( see \fIdelim\fR)"
with the \-f option. Lines with no delimiters are passwd through
untouched"
.PP
\fICut\fR extracts one or more fields or columns from a file and writes them on
standard output.
If the \fB\-f\fR flag is used, the fields are separated by a delimiter 
character, normally a tab, but can be changed using the \fB\-d\fR flag.
If the \fB\-c\fR flag is used, specific columns can be specified.
The list can be comma or BLANK separated. The \fB\-f\fR and
\fB\-c\fR flags  are mutually exclusive.
Note: The POSIX1003.2 standard requires the option \-b to cut out
specific bytes in a file. It is intended for systems with multi byte
characters (e.g. kanji), since MINIX uses only one byte characters,
this option is equivalent to \-c. For the same reason, the option
\-n has no effect and is not listed in this manual page.
