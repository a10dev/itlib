.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIBtoa\fR is a filter that converts a binary file to ascii for transmission
over a telephone line.  If two file names are provided, the first in used for
input and the second for output.  If only one is provided, it is used as the
input file.  The program is a functionally similar alternative 
to \fIuue/uud\fR, but the encoding is completely different.
Since both of these are widely used, both have been provided with 
\s-2MINIX\s+2.
The file is expanded about 25 percent in the process.
