.SH DESCRIPTION
Without any of the

shows the ethernet address, IP address and hostname of the local host on one
line in the given order.  With options only the wanted fields are shown,
still in the same order, not in option order.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-e
Show the ethernet address.
.TP
.B \-i
Show the IP address.  This will not work if no IP address has been found by
RARP or by setting it with
.BR ifconfig (8).
.TP
.B \-a
Show the fully qualified hostname.  The IP address is shown again if it
can't be translated to a host name.  (This usually indicates that the
DNS reverse address translation tables are incomplete.)
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.BR rarpd (8),
.BR nonamed (8),
.BR set_net_default (8),
.BR boot (8).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

.br
.B Hostaddr
timed out trying to get the IP address.  This means that the network connection
is out of order or that the setup of the machine is bad.
