.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fITreecmp\fR recursively descends the directory tree of its second
argument and compares all files to those at the corresponding position in 
the first argument.  
If the two trees are identical, i.e., all the corresponding
directories and files are the same, there is no output.  Otherwise, a list
of files missing from one of the trees or present in both but whose contents
are not identical in both are printed.
When the \fB\-c\fR flag is given, only files that are changed from the old
version or are new (i.e., absent in the old version) are listed.
