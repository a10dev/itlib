.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sometimes one knows about an i-node number and wants to find the file
name that goes with it.  This program makes that mapping.
The default is to list everything on the device, but the \fB\-i\fR
flag restricts the list to specified i-nodes and the \fB\-s\fR flag
restricts it to special files and setuid files (to look for possible
security violations).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR fsck (1).
