FIPS is a program to split an MS-DOS partition in two.  If your hard disk
contains only one partition, for MS-DOS/Windows, you will have to split it
to run MINIX.  First run scandisk to repair any errors in the file system.
Then run defrag to compact the partition.  Then you can use fips to split
the partition.

Before starting, please read README.1st, FIPS.DOC, FIPS,FAQ, and SPECIAL.DOC.
